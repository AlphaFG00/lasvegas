                            <p>
                            Iron Maiden are a British heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. <br>
Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's <br>
 live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their 2010 studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim. Their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success.
Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Observer reporting in 2015 that the band have sold over 90 million copies of their albums worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, "Eddie", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.

                            <p>Founded among the steel mills of Birmingham, England in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward formed what would arguably become the greatest heavy metal band of all time. Initially a heavy blues rock band named Earth, the band took occult and horror themes and combined them with heavily distorted down-tuned guitars and invented a genre that is as vibrant today as ever. Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, substance abuse and war. Releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971) are looked upon as vanguards, records which influenced artists as varied as Iron Maiden, Metallica and Soundgarden. <br>
										Black Sabbath was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Ranked by MTV as the "Greatest Metal Band" of all time, they have sold over 70 million records and countless concert tickets worldwide.<br>

                            <p>The beginning of this story has been told many times. The boy, barely six years old, is urged onstage to sing alongside his superstar father. The boy has rehearsed his part, he knows it well, but faced with a sea of tens of thousands of faces, he gets frightened. <br>
										<br>
										And for well over a decade he never... More sings in public again.<br>
										What happens next has also been told. The boy grows up, studies architecture, and somewhere down the line discovers that what once terrified him is the only thing that can now satisfy him.
										<br>
										In 1992, Alejandro Fernandez released his debut, self-titled album, launching one of the most prolific, successful and memorable careers in Latin music. Since then, the son of legendary ranchera singer Vicente Fernandez has done what few progeny of famous parents have ever been able to achieve: He's followed in his father's footsteps, but at the same time, he's carved out his own, separate path, releasing 15 albums and selling more than 12 million copies along the way thanks to a magnificent, velvety voice and an unparalleled stage presence.

The Grammy Award-winning international icon knows how to satisfy those universal, unanimous urges we all have, and he does so with his boldest offering yet."I wanted to be straightforward," he declares. "The title describes exactly what the album is about. From day one, I knew that I was going to call it SEX AND LOVE. You're going to find songs that mix the two sides, and you're going to find songs that focus on one or the other. Some of it is fun and obviously sexual, while some of it is more introspective and nostalgic. The words go together, but they can be separate and inspire different feelings and thoughts. It's all-encompassing." <br>

										<br>
											"I've been preparing for this moment my entire life," Lopez said in a prepared release. "The show is going to be a multifaceted high energy Jenny from the Block party, mixing all aspects of what my fans and I love — dance, hip hop, Latin and pop. It's going to be the show I've always dreamt of creating."
										<br>
										As far back as December, AEG Live executives had said the only obstacles were due to scheduling for the 45-year-old star, not her desire to headline.

                            <h3>Dollar Piano</h3>
                            
                            
                            <p>World-renowned singer, songwriter and performer Elton John gives fans exactly what they're looking for in his Las Vegas show, "The Million Dollar Piano." Playing exclusively at The Colosseum inside Caesars Palace, the show's centerpiece is the namesake piano. This engineering marvel displays more than 68 LED Yamaha video screens. The visuals complement Elton's performances perfectly. It also weighs more than 3,000 pounds—the weight of an average car. While the piano dominates the stage, the surrounding set design is also a beauty, so expect lots of gold and stunning visual effects.

											The dazzling superstar's band includes Davey Johnstone on guitar, Matt Bissonette on bass, John Mahon on percussion, Nigel Olsson on drums and Kim Bullard on keyboards, with a special appearance by percussionist Ray Cooper. Before or after the show, have a cocktail at Fizz, located next door to The Colosseum. The swanky, high-end champagne bar is co-owned by Elton's partner David Furnish, and features art from the couple's personal collection.

										As far back as December, AEG Live executives had said the only obstacles were due to scheduling for the 45-year-old star, not her desire to headline.

                            <p>Rod Stewart's soulful voice, narrative songwriting, and passionate live performances, have given him one of the most prolific and successful musical careers of all time.
